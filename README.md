This project consists of the creation of a grid where people can draw with the move of the mouse. The grid is automatically generated using DOM manipulation.

Each square is filled with color after the user moves over it. As a way to prevent drawing while on the grid, if the user holds the shift key while moving the square is not filled.

Four buttons can be found above the drawing area. The first one (Set new grid) is used to create a new grid with a number the user submits to define the number of squares per row or column, this also removes the old grid. The other ones are related with the filler color for the squares.
